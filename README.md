# Calculator Application with Live Updates

> 3 hour effort

I built a simple calculator applicaiton that delivers live updates when a user sumbits a calculation. The intention behind this project was to get familiar with WebSocket technology for more effective bi-directional communication. This will save time and effort compared to long-polling, heartbeats, and other http oriented methods.
