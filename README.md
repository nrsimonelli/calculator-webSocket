# Calculator Application with Live Updates

> 3 hour effort

I built a simple calculator applicaiton that delivers live updates when a user sumbits a calculation. The intention behind this project was to get familiar with Webhooks for server oriented communication to the client rather than relying on client to server communicaiton. This will save resources compared to constantly pinging the server for updates.
